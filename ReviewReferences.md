1. Nemana, V. (2010). On Inequality Measurement.

   (1) p. 9: Some common summary measures of inequality include the variance, the coefficient of variation, the relative mean deviation,
            the Gini coefficient, the standard deviation of logarithms, Atkinson's family of measures based on the Social Welfare Function,
            and the Generalized Entropy family of indices which include Theil's entropy index.
   
   (2) p. 10: The two objectives when comparing two distributions are to 1) rank the distributions in terms of overall equity and 2)
             quantify the difference in equality between the two distributions - that is, separate the "shifts" in each distribution from
             differences in its shape.

   (3) p. 12: Fractile methods and their related criteria are somewhat crude in that they ignore the distribution of income within fractiles.
              A natural way around this problem is to use the Lorenz curve.
   
   (4) p. 13: even the Gini coefficient does not tell us anything about the underlying form of the SWF and leads to confusion when comparing distributions of different means.

             (Question) We want to measure inequality. Why do we have to know the SWF (social welfare function)?

   (5) p. 14: The Theil "entropy" measure of inequality is derived from information theory, where the probability of an event and
              the informative value of a message saying the event has occurred is substituted for the distribution of income shares.

             (Question) We should not consider that all the information is about inequality. Some information is about inequality, while some is about equality.

   (6) p. 19: One Compelling, intuitive benefit of standard summary measures such as the variance, the coefficient of variation, and the Gini coefficient is the immediate
             focus they place on fundamental income differences. The variance and the coefficient of variation, for instance, represent the average squared difference
             between each income and the mean, while the Gini coefficient is the normalized expected value of the absolute difference between any two randomly selected
             incomes in the population.

             (Question) Do income differences reflect inequality? I think the answer is no.

   (7) p. 19: the essence of the decomposition problem is to represent overall inequality as a function of subgroup inequalities.
             The specifics of decomposition depend on the subgroup inequality, the subgroup's population share, and its share of the total income.

            (Question) We need to investigate the decomposability of the $L_2$ index (or the alternative of the $L_2$ index).

   (8) p. 22: Internationally, the World Bank shifted its stance towards reducing absolute poverty instead of inequality.

            (Question) We need to study the currently available poverty indexes. Check what poverty is. Check if poverty requires two distributions. Check if poverty is related to inequality.


             (Question) This survey paper does not consider what inequality is.
             This paper assumes that the currently available inequality indexes measure inequality.

    (1) p. 2: Figure 1 can be applied to depict the possible UD income distributions given the total UD income.

    (2) The author does not distinguish between discrete and continuous distributions.
        In most cases, the author considers that the population is finite.
        We can not assume a continuous distribution for a finite population.
        We should note that the CDF and QF for a discrete distribution provide different information about the population.

    (3) p. 17, 18: The generalized Lorenz curve and the conventional Lorenz curve (relative Lorenz curve) are defined and compared.

    (4) p. 25, 26: Definition and interpretations of the Gini coefficient are well explained.

    (1) p. 1: Given the population size and the distribution of income, the two questions that arise in a person's mind are:
              what is the mean income and how unequally is the total income distributed among the individuals in the society?
              Loosely speaking, income inequality represents interpersonal income differences within a given population.

         (Question) Is this definition of income inequality correct?
   
   (2) p. 2: For a population of size $n$, a typical income distribution is a vector $x = \left( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \right)$,
             where $x_i \geq 0$ is the income of person $i$. It is assumed that no ambiguity arises with the definitions of income,
             income earning unit, and the reference period over which income is observed.
   
         (Question) The author assumes that the population is finite. Can the income for the finite population be continuous?

         (Question) The author assumes that the income is non-negative. Is it realistic that the income is non-negative?

   (3) p. 5: In the case of complete inequality where only one person has positive income and all other persons have zero income,
             the curve runs through the horizontal axis until we reach the richest person and then it rises perpendicularly.

         (Question) Complete inequality depends on the assumption that the income is non-negative.

   (4) p. 15: This general definition of the Lorenz curve was suggested by Gastwirth (1971).
              It applies to distributions of both discrete and continuous types.

5. Foster, J. and Sen, A. (1997) On Economic Inequality. The expanded edition. Oxford University Press Inc., New York.

     (1) p. 2: The measures of inequality that have been proposed in the economic literature fall broadly into two categories.
               On the one hand, there are measures that try to catch the extent of inequality in some objective sense,
               usually employing some measures of relative variation of income, and on the other there are indices
               that try to measure inequality in terms of some normative notion of social welfare so that a higher degree of inequality
               corresponds to a lower level of social welfare for a given total of income.
               It is possible to argue that there are some advantages in taking the former approach so that one can distinguish
               between (a) 'seeing' more or less inequality, and (b) 'valuing' it more or less in ethical terms.
               In the second, approach inequality ceases to be an  objective notion and the problem of measurement
              is enmeshed with that of ethical evaluation.

          (Question) The authors mention that inequality is statistically measured by some relative dispersion measures.
                     The authors do not know that dispersion is not equal to inequality.
      (2) p. 5: Most statistical measures of inequality level assume a high degree of measurement,
                usually a ratio scale or at least an interval scale.
                This is true not only the so-called objective measures but also of normative evaluation.

         (Question) Is income a ratio scale? What if income can be negative?

      (3) pp. 24 - 38: The authors discuss a number of measures of inequality such as the range, the relative mean deviation,
                the coefficient of variation, the standard deviation of logarithms, the Gini coefficient, the relative mean difference,
                Theil's entropy measure, Dalton's measure, Atkinson's measure, etc.
