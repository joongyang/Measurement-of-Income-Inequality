1. Nemana, V. (2010). On Inequality Measurement.

   (1) p. 9: Some common summary measures of inequality include the variance, the coefficient of variation, the relative mean deviation,
            the Gini coefficient, the standard deviation of logarithms, Atkinson's family of measures based on the Social Welfare Function,
            and the Generalized Entropy family of indices which include Theil's entropy index.
   
   (2) p. 10: The two objectives when comparing two distributions are to 1) rank the distributions in terms of overall equity and 2)
             quantify the difference in equality between the two distributions - that is, separate the "shifts" in each distribution from
             differences in its shape.

   (3) p. 12: Fractile methods and their related criteria are somewhat crude in that they ignore the distribution of income within fractiles.
              A natural way around this problem is to use the Lorenz curve.
   
   (4) p. 13: even the Gini coefficient does not tell us anything about the underlying form of the SWF and leads to confusion when comparing distributions of different means.

             *We want to measure inequality. Why do we have to know the SWF (social welfare function)?*

   (5) p. 14: The Theil "entropy" measure of inequality is derived from information theory, where the probability of an event and the informative value of a message
             saying the event has occurred are substituted for the distribution of income shares.

             *We should not consider that all the information is about inequality. Some information is about inequality, while some is about equality.*

   (6) p. 19: One Compelling, intuitive benefit of standard summary measures such as the variance, the coefficient of variation, and the Gini coefficient is the immediate
             focus they place on fundamental income differences. The variance and the coefficient of variation, for instance, represent the average squared difference
             between each income and the mean, while the Gini coefficient is the normalized expected value of the absolute difference between any two randomly selected
             incomes in the population.

            *Do income differences reflect inequality? I think the answer is no.*

   (7) p. 19: the essence of the decomposition problem is to represent overall inequality as a function of subgroup inequalities.
             The specifics of decomposition depend on the subgroup inequality, the subgroup's population share, and its share of the total income.

           *We need to investigate the decomposability of the $L_2$ index (or the alternative of the $L_2$ index).*

   (8) p. 22: Internationally, the World Bank shifted its stance towards reducing absolute poverty instead of inequality.

           *We need to study the currently available poverty indexes. Check what poverty is. Check if poverty requires two distributions. Check if poverty is related to inequality.*


            *This survey paper does not consider what inequality is.
             This paper assumes that the currently available inequality indexes measure inequality.*

    (1) p. 2: Figure 1 can be applied to depict the possible UD income distributions given the total UD income.

    (2) The author does not distinguish between discrete and continuous distributions.
        In most cases, the author considers that the population is finite.
        We can not assume a continuous distribution for a finite population.
        We should note that the CDF and QF for a discrete distribution provide different information about the population.

    (3) p. 17, 18: The generalized Lorenz curve and the conventional Lorenz curve (relative Lorenz curve) are defined and compared.

    (4) p. 25, 26: Definition and interpretations of the Gini coefficient are well explained.
