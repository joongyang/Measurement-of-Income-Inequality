# Negtive income

**Negative income** typically refers to a situation where an individual or entity's total expenses exceed their total income, resulting in a net loss.
It is also commonly known as a "negative taxable income" or "tax loss."
For example, if a business spends $10,000 on rent, utilities, and supplies, but only earns $8,000 in revenue, the business has a negative income of $2,000.
This means the business is losing money.

Another example is an individual who has more deductions and expenses than his/her earnings.
This may happen if the person has a low-paying job or is unemployed and has significant medical expenses or other deductions.

Tanaka, Camerer, and Nguyen (2010) and Damon, Di Falco, and Kohlin (2011) show that individuals in Vietnam and Ethiopia experienced negative incomes due to droughts.

## How to deal with negative incomes

The conventional indexes are based on the assumption that income is non-negative or positive.
However, negative incomes are observed in reality.
There exists an inconsistency between reality and assumption.
The recommended remedial actions are

1. to delete negative income values,
2. to replace negative income values with zero or arbitrarily small positive values.

These actions adjust the data. Data is a collection of facts. Adjustment of data is no more than the distortion of reality. Instead, we should modify the unrealistic assumption.

Some studies attempt to adjust the indexes. Chen, Tsaur, and Rhai (1982) renormalize and reformulate the Gini coefficient for the distribution with some negative incomes. Berrebi and Silber (1985) correct and extend Chen, Tsaur, and Rhai (1982). Raffinetti, Siletti, and Vernizzi (2017) reformulate the Gini-based inequality measures in the presence of negative income values.

## Scale of income

Income can take negative values.
This implies that income is not a ratio scale.
Income is an interval scale.
Therefore, any index involving income share $y_i / S_y$ is theoretically incorrect.
Any index involving division by $\mu_y$ is theoretically incorrect as well.

## Positive total income assumption

The non-negative income assumption does not represent reality since negative incomes are observed in reality.
We need a realistic assumption about income that allows negative values.
We thus assume that the total income $S_y$ is positive.
