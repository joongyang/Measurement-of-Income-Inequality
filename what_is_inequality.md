# What is inequality?

Income inequality is a subconcept of economic inequality.
Economic inequality is a subconcept of inequality.
Therefore, it is reasonable to begin with the definition of inequality.
Many references define inequality by mentioning subconcepts such as economic inequality and income inequality.
Here are some definitions of inequality without mentioning subconcepts.

*Concepts of inequality* (2015)[https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wess/wess_dev_issues/dsp_policy_01.pdf]
defines inequality as the state of not being equal, especially in status, rights, and opportunities.

The state of being equal in status, rights, and opportunities is equality.
Therefore, inequality is non-equality.
The above definition corresponds to the following definition.

 Cowell (2011, p. 1)[https://academic.oup.com/book/11568] defines inequality as a departure from equality.

Many references define inequality as the dispersion of a distribution, whether it be income, consumption, or some other welfare indicator or attribute of a population.
This definition causes misunderstanding.
Equality is a distribution with zero dispersion.
Inequality is a distribution with non-zero dispersion.
