# Dispersion of An Income Distribution


Dispersion: The amount by which a set of observations deviate from their mean. When the values of a set of observations are close to their mean, the dispersion is less than when they are spread out widely from the mean. [The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/statistics-probability/statistics-and-probability-general-interest/cambridge-dictionary-statistics-4th-edition?format=HB&isbn=9780521766999) 

When $\mathbf{y}$ is not equal to $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$, there is income inequality in $\mathbf{y}$.

One obvious difference between $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$ is that $\mathbf{y}$ has non-zero dispersion, while $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$ has zero dispersion.
