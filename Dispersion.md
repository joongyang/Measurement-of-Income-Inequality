# Dispersion of An Income Distribution

Dispersion: The amount by which a set of observations deviate from their mean. When the values of a set of observations are close to their mean, the dispersion is less than when they are spread out widely from the mean. [The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/statistics-probability/statistics-and-probability-general-interest/cambridge-dictionary-statistics-4th-edition?format=HB&isbn=9780521766999) 

Income inequality metrics simply provide a system of measurement used to determine the dispersion of incomes. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics)

 An inequality measure is a scalar numerical representation of interpersonal differences in income within a given population. [Cowell (2011)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/measuring-inequality-9780199594047)

According to the above definitions, the degree of income inequality has been measured by the dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$.

When $\mathbf{y}$ is not equal to $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$, there is income inequality in $\mathbf{y}$.

$\mathbf{y}$ has non-zero dispersion, while $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$ has zero dispersion.

Non-zero dispersion implies the existence of inequality.

However, the magnitude of dispersion is not the degree of income inequality.


The dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ represents the differences between $y_i$'s in $\mathbf{y}$.

The dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ has nothing to do with $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$.

The dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ does not compare $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$.

The dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ does not show a relationship of $\mathbf{y}$ with $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$.

Therefore, any income inequality index measuring the dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ does not represent income inequality properly.
