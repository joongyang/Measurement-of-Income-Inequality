# Dispersion of An Income Distribution

Dispersion: The amount by which a set of observations deviates from their mean. When the values of a set of observations are close to their mean, the dispersion is less than when they are spread out widely from the mean. [The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/statistics-probability/statistics-and-probability-general-interest/cambridge-dictionary-statistics-4th-edition?format=HB&isbn=9780521766999) 

1. Income inequality metrics simply provide a system of measurement used to determine the dispersion of incomes. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics)

2. An inequality measure is a scalar numerical representation of interpersonal differences in income within a given population. [Cowell (2011)](Cowell, Frank, Measuring Inequality, 3rd edn, London School of Economics Perspectives in Economic Analysis (Oxford, 2011; online edn, Oxford Academic, 30 Apr. 2015, https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199594030.001.0001)
   
3. Loosely speaking, income inequality represents interpersonal income differences within a given population. [Chakravarty, S. R. (2009). The Measurement of Income Inequality. In: Inequality, Polarization and Poverty. Economic Studies in Inequality, Social Exclusion and Well-Being, vol 6. Springer, New York, NY.]( https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-79253-8_1).

4. There are measures that try to catch the extent of inequality in some objective sense, usually employing some measures of relative variation of income. [Foster, J. and Sen, A. (1997, p. 2) On Economic Inequality. The expanded edition. Oxford University Press Inc., New York.]()

According to the above definitions, the degree of income inequality has been measured by the dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$.
When $\mathbf{y}$ is not equal to $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$, there is income inequality in $\mathbf{y}$.

$\mathbf{y}$ has non-zero dispersion, while $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$ has zero dispersion.
Non-zero dispersion implies the existence of inequality.
However, the magnitude of dispersion is not the degree of income inequality.


The dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ represents the differences between $y_i$'s in $\mathbf{y}$.
The dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ has nothing to do with $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$.

The dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ does not compare $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$.

The dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ does not show a relationship of $\mathbf{y}$ with $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$.
Therefore, any income inequality index measuring the dispersion of $\mathbf{y}$ does not represent income inequality properly.
