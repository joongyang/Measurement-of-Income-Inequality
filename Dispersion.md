# Dispersion of An Income Distribution


Dispersion: The amount by which a set of observations deviate from their mean. When the values of a set of observations are close to their mean, the dispersion is less than when they are spread out widely from the mean. [The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/statistics-probability/statistics-and-probability-general-interest/cambridge-dictionary-statistics-4th-edition?format=HB&isbn=9780521766999) 

Income inequality metrics simply provide a system of measurement used to determine the dispersion of incomes. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics)

 An inequality measure is a scalar numerical representation of interpersonal differences in income within a given population. [Cowell (2011)](https://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Inequality-Economics-Perspectives-Economic/dp/019959404X?asin=019959404X&revisionId=&format=4&depth=1](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/measuring-inequality-9780199594047)


When $\mathbf{y}$ is not equal to $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$, there is income inequality in $\mathbf{y}$.

One obvious difference between $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$ is that $\mathbf{y}$ has non-zero dispersion, while $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$ has zero dispersion.
