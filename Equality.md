# Representaion of Equality

Consider a population of $n$ individuals.
Suppose that $y_1 \leq y_2 \leq \leq \dots \leq y_n$ are the ordered incomes of the $n$ individuals.

Equality is an income distribution in which the total income $S_y = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$ is evenly distributed among $n$ individuals.
Sometimes, it is referred to as perfect equality or complete equality.

Equality can be represented mathematically in several ways:

1. $y_i = \mu_y$ for all $i$, where $\mu_y = S_y / n$

2. $y_1 = y_n$

3. $y_1 = \mu_y$

4. $y_n = \mu_y$

An important property of equality is zero dispersion.
If an income distribution has zero dispersion, it is equality.
The above four representations suggest four measures for dispersion.
They are respectively statistics involving $\left( y_i - \mu_y \right)$ such as variance, $y_n - y_1$, $\mu_y - y_1$, and $y_n - \mu_y$.
The corresponding income distribution is not equality if any of these dispersion measures is not zero.
That is, nonzero dispersion implies non-equality, i.e., the existence of inequality.
However, we should note that dispersion does not measure the extent of inequality.
