# Representaion of Equality

Consider a population of $n$ individuals.
Suppose that $y_1 \leq y_2 \leq \leq \dots \leq y_n$ are the ordered incomes of the $n$ individuals.

Equality is an income distribution in which the total income $S_y$ is evenly distributed among $n$ individuals of the population.
