# Representaion of Equality

Consider a population of $n$ individuals.
Suppose that $y_1 \leq y_2 \leq \leq \dots \leq y_n$ are the ordered incomes of the $n$ individuals.
Equality is an income distribution in which the total income $S_y = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$ is evenly distributed among $n$ individuals.
Sometimes, it is referred to as perfect equality or complete equality.

Equality can be represented mathematically in a number of ways:

1. $y_i = \mu_y$ for all $i$, where $\mu_y = S_y / n$

2.
