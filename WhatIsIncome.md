# What is income?

**Income** is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms.
Income is difficult to define conceptually and the definition may be different across fields.
For example, a person's income in an economic sense may be different from their income as defined by law.

1. For households and individuals, income is defined by tax law as a sum that includes any wage, salary, profit, interest payment, rent, or other form of earnings received in a calendar year.

2. **Factor income** is the return accruing for a person, or a nation, derived from the factors of production.
   Factor income includes rental income, wages generated by labor, the interest created by capital, and profits from entrepreneurial ventures.
   
3. For households and individuals, **gross income** is the sum of all wages, salaries, profits, interest payments, rents, and other forms of earnings, before any deductions or taxes.
   It is opposed to **net income**, defined as the gross income minus taxes and other deductions (e.g., mandatory pension contributions).
   For a firm, gross income (also gross profit, sales profit, or credit sales) is the difference between revenue and the cost of making a product or providing a service,
   before deducting overheads, payroll, taxation, and interest payments.
   Net income nets out expenses: net income equals revenue minus cost of goods sold, expenses, depreciation, interest, and taxes.
   
4. **Disposable income** is total personal income minus current income taxes.
   In national accounts definitions, **personal income** minus personal current taxes equals disposable personal income.
   Subtracting personal outlays (which includes the major category of personal [or private] consumption expenditure) yields personal (or, private) savings,
   hence the income left after paying away all the taxes is referred to as disposable income.

5. **Discretionary income** is disposable income (after-tax income), minus all payments that are necessary to meet current bills.
   It is total personal income after subtracting taxes and minimal survival expenses (such as food, medicine, rent or mortgage, utilities, insurance, transportation, property maintenance, child support, etc.)
   to maintain a certain standard of living.
   It is the amount of an individual's income available for spending after the essentials have been taken care of:

   Discretionary income = gross income – taxes – all compelled payments (bills)

6. In the field of public economics, income may comprise the accumulation of both monetary and non-monetary consumption ability,
    with the former (monetary) being used as a proxy for total income.
