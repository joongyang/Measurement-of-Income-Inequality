# Income Inequality

Suppose a population with $n$ individuals.
Denote ordered income values of $n$ individuals by $y_1 \le y_2 \le y_3 \le \dots \le y_n $.

$S_y = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$ and $\mu_y = S_y / n$ are the total income and mean income, respectively.
Denote the distribution of $S_y$ over $n$ individuals by $\mathbf{y} = \left( y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n \right)$.
We refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as the income distribution.

When $S_y$ is evenly distributed over $n$ individuals, the income distribution is $\mathbf{y}_{pe} = \left( \mu_y, \mu_y, \dots, \mu_y \right)$.

$\mathbf{y}_{pe}$ represents equality for $\mathbf{y}$.

When $\mathbf{y}$ is not equal to $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$, there is income inequality in $\mathbf{y}$.

The degree of income inequality can be measured by the discrepancy between $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{y}_{pe}$.
